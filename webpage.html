<p><span style="font-family:monospace;">This is a webpage with a little information about me. I am originally from Fort Smith, Arkansas &amp; have been living in Colorado since 2016. I'm a senior in computer science at Mines &amp; am graduating in May. Some of my interests include machine learning, dance, martial arts, &amp; any kind of art I have time for. In my freetime, I'm most likely helping out with Ballroom Dance Club (tango dance captain &amp; advertising coordinator), Aikido Club (president), &amp; practicing with our campus's kpop crew for performances later in the semester.</span></p>
